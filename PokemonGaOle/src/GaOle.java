		//  Catch Time!:
		//create a set of 3 pokemons, which will be done by stage object's
		//constructor method upon initialization, then display the choices on
		//screen, then player catches one of the pokemons with catchOne() method
		
		//  Battle Time!:
		//generate two wild pokemon, then display their type and affinities
		//with the departForBattle method, then ask player which one of their
		//pokemon would they like to send.
		// (this section is handled by the departForBattle() method)
		
		//  Extra Battles!:
		//use extraBattles() method, which is similar to departForBattle() but
		//has a chance of activating, otherwise it will just do nothing and
		//move on
		
		//  Check your Results!:
		//run displayResults() method, which will display the battle score
		//acquired during all the battles. then using the leaderboard.txt file,
		//we display the top 5 high-scores, if the acquired score beats them,
		//then overwrite and shift the list to add the new score. if the list
		//is empty (ie file hasnt been created yet), then create the file.
		//if the file has entries but less than five, then add the new score
		//and place it in the correct order, no need to overwrite anything.
		
		//  Ga-Ole Medals
		//golden chip and golden sand drops randomly when pokemons are caught
		//in battle. and then they are converted into Ga-Ole medals, which
		//accumulate somewhere?? when a certain amount of medals accumulate,
		//something cool happens
