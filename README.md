# Pokemon GaOle Game

A collaborated final project to design a Pokemon GaOle game on a backend UI/UX terminal interface in its respective IDE. A core feature is that the game is able to be played on a CLI terminal! Our inspiration in designing this project is taken from the arcade version of the Pokemkn GaOle game which is an original created in Japan.

The uniqueness of this game is the ability to run it in the CLI and a leaderboard is also maintained in a database to allow players to check their final HI-scores.
